...down the block to where the cop car's siren spun (10)a dizzy blue. The nose of that yellow Cadillac was (20)all pleated like an alligator's, and except for a bloody (30)lip and a bruised forehead, Louie's cousin was okay. They (40)put handcuffs on him and put him in the backseat (50)of the cop car, and we all waved as they (60)drove away. Marin Marin's boyfriend is in Puerto Rico. She (70)shows us his letters and makes us promise not to (80)tell anybody they're getting married when she goes back to (90)P.R. She says he didn't get a job yet, but (100)she's saving the money she gets from selling Avon and (110)taking care of her cousins. Marin says that if she (120)stays here next year, she's going to get a real (130)job downtown because that's where the best jobs are, since (140)you always get to look beautiful and get to wear (150)nice clothes and can meet someone in the subway who (160)might marry you and take you to live in a (170)big house far away. But next year Louie's parents are (180)going to send her back to her mother with a (190)letter saying she's too much trouble, and that is too (200)bad because I like Marin. She is older and knows (210)lots of things. She is the one who drives the (220)men crazy and laughs them all away. Her power is (230)her own. She will not give it away. I have (240)begun my own quiet war. Simple. Sure. I am one (250)who leaves the table like a man, without putting back (260)the chair or picking up the plate. A Smart Cookie (270)I could've been somebody, you know? Esperanza, you go to (280)school. Study hard. That Madame Butterfly was a fool. She (290)stirs the oatmeal. Look at my comadres. She means Izaura (300)whose husband left and Yolanda whose husband is dead. Got (310)to take care all your own, she says shaking her (320)head. Then out of nowhere: Shame is a bad thing, (330)you know? It keeps you down. You want to know (340)why I quit school? Because I didn't have nice clothes. (350)No clothes, but I had brains. Yup, she says disgusted, (360)stirring again. I was a smart cookie then. What Sally (370)Said He never hits me hard. But Sally doesn't tell (380)about that time he hit her with his hands just (390)like a dog, she said, like if I was an (400)animal. He thinks I'm going to run away like his (410)sisters who made the family ashamed. Just because I'm a (420)daughter, and then she doesn't say. Sally was going to (430)get permission to stay with us a little and one (440)Thursday she came finally with a sack full of clothes (450)and a paper bag of sweetbread her mama sent. And (460)would've stayed too except when the dark came her father, (470)whose eyes were little from crying, knocked on the door (480)and said please come back, this is the last time. (490)And she said Daddy and went home. Then we didn't (500)need to worry. Until one day Sally's father catches her (510)talking to a boy and the next day a yellow (520)bird flew in through an open window. Before the week (530)was over, the baby's fever was worse. Then Jesus came (540)and took the baby with him far away. That's what (550)their mother said. Then the visitors came ... in and (560)out of the little house. It was hard to keep (570)the floors clean. Anybody who had ever wondered what color (580)the walls were came and came to look at that (590)little thumb of a human in a box like candy. (600)I had never seen the dead before, not for real, (610)not in somebody's living room for people to kiss and (620)bless themselves and light a candle for. Not in a (630)house. It seemed strange. They must've known, the sisters. They (640)had the power and could sense what was what. They (650)said, Come here, and gave me a stick of gum. (660)They smelled like Kleenex or the inside of a satin (670)handbag, and then I didn't feel afraid. What's your name, (680)the cat-eyed one asked. Esperanza, I said. Esperanza, the old (690)blue-veined one repeated in a high thin voice. Esperanza ... (700)a good good name. My knees hurt, the one with (710)the funny laugh complained. Tomorrow it will rain. Yes, tomorrow, (720)they said. How do you know? I asked. We know, (730)we know. Esperanza. The one with marble hands called me (740)aside. Esperanza. She held my face with her blue-veined hands (750)and looked and looked at me. A long silence. When (760)you leave you must remember always to come back, she (770)said. What? When you leave you must remember to come (780)back. For the ones I left behind. For the ones (790)who cannot out. A Note About the Author Sandra Cisneros (800)was born in Chicago on December 20, 1954, the third (810)child in a family of little sisters. He is my (820)brother's friend really, but I know he has two cousins (830)and that his T-shirts never stay tucked in his pants. (840)Louie's girl cousin is older than us. She lives with (850)Louie's family because her own family is in Puerto Rico. (860)Her name is Marin or Maris or something like that, (870)and she wears dark nylons all the time and lots (880)of makeup she gets free from selling Avon. She can't (890)come out--gotta baby-sit with Louie's sisters--but she stands in the (900)doorway a lot, all the time singing, clicking her fingers, (910)the same song: Apples, peaches, pumpkin pah-ay. You're in love (920)and so am ah-ay. Louie has another cousin. We only (930)saw him once, but it was important. We were playing (940)volleyball in the alley when he drove up in this (950)great big yellow Cadillac with whitewalls and a yellow scarf (960)tied around the mirror. Louie's cousin had his arm out (970)the window. He honked a couple of times and a (980)lot of faces looked out from Louie's back window and (990)then a lot of people came out--Louie, Marin and all (1000)...
